<!-- Linkedin Bio -->
<!-- I am passionate about the intersection of technology, public policy, and human rights. 

Born and raised in California, I have lived and worked in 4 different countries on 3 different continents. In high school, I had the honor to receive several fully-funded opportunities to learn and practice youth leadership in South Africa and India. These experiences propelled me to apply to international universities, where I eventually received a full-ride scholarship to attend NYU Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. There, alongside my studies, I devoted myself to activism in climate change policy and LGBTQ+ rights. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor's in Social Research and Public Policy with a minor in Computer Science, infusing qualitative analysis with quantitative methods.

These international experiences have equipped me with valuable insights in discovering issues, analyzing root causes, devising potential solutions, and effecting social change for a more equitable future. I hope to use my technical background and human-oriented approach to drive greater social impact, especially for the climate change policy and LGBTQ+ rights. -->
